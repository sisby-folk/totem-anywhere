**Totem Anywhere Standalone** is a single-mixin adaptation of the `totems-work-in-inventory` module from [Charm](https://modrinth.com/mod/charm).

Totems of undying will activate on death when in any slot of your inventory, not just your offhand.


## Further Info

All mods are built on the work of many others.

We made this mod for [Tinkerer's Quilt](https://modrinth.com/modpack/tinkerers-quilt) - our modpack about ease of
play and vanilla content.


We're open to suggestions for how to implement stuff better - if you see something wonky and have an idea - let us know.
